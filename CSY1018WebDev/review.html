        <h5>Codepen</h5>
        <p>Codepen is "At its heart, it allows you to write code in the browser, and see the results of it as you build. A useful and liberating tool for developers of any skill, and particularly empowering for people learning to code. We focus primarily on front-end languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and preprocessing syntaxes that turn into those things." So in other words, Codepen is another online code learning website (a lot like Thimble).

            This website is along the same lines as Thimble in the way that it helps users learn HTML, CSS or Java through tutorials and fun games found all across the site. Inside an actual project it holds four different windows; 3 for the code (HTML, CSS and Java) and one for the output at the bottom.
            
            A cool feature Codepen has it the ability to share projects and code around for other to view and to perhaps take inspiration from. This is called Forking. It carries over all the code on page to another page where you can edit and add other features to it. Pretty neat, right?
            
            Codepen.io is an amazing website for both people looking to get into coding and for people who are already professionals in the field. It has a wide range of tutorials on the site and the best part about it is how you can learn this code at your own pace. Although I prefer Thimble over Codepen, Codepen is still a good website to use.

        <div class="Thimble">
         <h5>Thimble</h5>
         <p>As said on Mozilla's website "Thimble is an online code editor that makes it easy to create and publish your own web pages while learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript." It is completely free and it doesn't even require you to create an account even though it is recommended you do if you want to save your work.

            I think the website is incredibly useful as it really does help you with creating new code. It gives you short tutorials on the home page which actually helps you with your coding skills (unlike other websites I have visited) and offers much more help with learning HTML CSS and Javascript by having more tutorials on each coding language. The tutorials aren't boring either, for instance there is a tutorial for HTML about using the code to create your own virtual burger!
            
            Alongside these features, the actual program has the files set out for you (index.html and style.css) to get you familiar with how to set up a project correctly and how to name the files correctly using proper naming conventions. The greatest thing I have to say about the platform is how it also has a small box to show the fruits of your labour! Everything you code will automatically update on the output to show what it looks like.
            Personally I really like this website out of the two just because of the wide variety of features available on it. Codepen is still great and probably does have better features than Thimble, but in my opinion Thimble is fantastic for both aspiring programmers and programmers alike.
