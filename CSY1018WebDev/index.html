            <h3>About Me<br><br></h3>
            <p>
            When describing myself the main feature that appears is quite. In life I prefere to watch and observe rather than
            ask all the questions. This shows in my learning style as I gain better experience by hands on experience, often 
            teaching myself at my own speed. I wouldn't say im particually cleaver and take a considerable amount of time to 
            grasp new concepts which is never helped by often throwing myself right into the deep end when learning new areas.
            However, I would also say I am someone who tries their hardest. A part of me inside has a real desire to learn and 
            be the best i can be, so at times it's important to think back to these qualities no matter how hard of an area i 
            challenge myself at.

            <h3>Chosen Course<br><br></h3>
            <p>
            Currently I am on a Computer Games Development course at the University of Northampton. Computer science is an area
            I have never studied before so have set myself out with a real challenge. Growing up I was always creating new games
            to play at school with firends and had a real intrest in stories. This lead to my desicion to study CGD as it was 
            described as a course where not only would you learn about game design but also about coding and making your ideas
            come to life. As well as working on games, the course has enabled me to experience a variety of other computer science 
            areas such as Web Development, Databases and Software Engineering. Although struggling getting to grips with most modules
            is tough, the small imporvements seen in myself have been worth while.

            <h3>Interests<br><br></h3>
            <p>
            Outside of University I tend to keep to myself. Spending time with family and friends is often fun, but spending time 
            by myself is often very calming as my course revolves heavily around group work and other interactions. At times it is
            relaxing to switch of and reflect on other ambitions and hobbies. For me, I've played guitar since a young age so have 
            great pleasure in sitting down and learning new scales or skills, thinking of how they can be implimented into other 
            playing techniques. Another interest, which is something I find hard to do these days, is reading. Getting lost in a 
            book always has interested me, feeling like a small escape for me to relax for an hour or so.
            </p>

            <h3>Future<br><br></h3>
            <p>
           It is often hard to think about plans for the future as it is almost impossible to know what tomorrow might bring.
           Plans always change, but at this point the things I would want to achieve would be to graduate University with a decent
           grade, find employment in matching field being within the games industy or within software engineering which has become
           an interest of mine and finally buy a house which is a personal goal I've been saving for across many years now. The 
           biggest challenge to me here would be gaining the grades to succeed on this course allowing me to granduate, as right now
           it seems like a long way off with many obstacles in the way.
