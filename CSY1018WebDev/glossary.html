               <h6>HTML</h6>
               <p>HTML - HTML stands for ‘Hyper Text Markup Language’, it’s the language used for creating websites.<br>
                    Tag - Within HTM everything has a tag. The HTML tag is what contains all the other tags such as the ‘head’ and ‘body’ tags.<br>
                    Hyperlinks - These are links that the user can click on within the website and, upon doing so, they would be taken to whatever website the link might be for.<br>
                    Images - As to be expected, images are used within HTM using the ‘img’ tag which always follows a ‘src’ attribute that tells the website where to get the image from.<br>
                    Line Breaks - Line break tags (br) are used in blocks of text where it would create a line break in the text. Can be used for things like separating paragraphs into separate paragraphs, writing out an address, and displaying something like a poem.
                </p>
           </div>
           <div class="LISTS">
               <h6>Lists</h6>
               <p>Unordered Lists(li) - A lost where the items will show with simple bullet points.
                    Ordered Lists(ol) - These lists will be shown with numbers instead of a simple bullet point.
                </p>
            <div class="Attributes">
                <h6>Attributes</h6>
                <p>Class - To make changes to your website you should put just about everything into classes. Doing this will allow you to separately change things like the colour, font, size and other features of whatever is in the class once you’re editing things in CSS. It’s always good to have a few classes in your website so that things look more unique and eye-catching but it wouldn’t be wise to have ever sentence a part of a different class which has completely different CSS features than all the others.<br><br>

                        ID - An ID in HTML is very similar to what a Class is as it gives a part of the HTML it’s own unique section that can later  be edited with CSS but, unlike a Class, which can have multiple other parts assigned to it, an ID is used for only one thing. An example of this would be using an ID element for something like “Header” then using a Class for something like “Cake” in a cooking book which would follow what type of cake it is.<br><br>
                        
                        HREF - This part is fairly easy to understand and we use it every day when browsing the latest new and gossip on the internet. Using a HREF in your website will provide the user with a link that they can use to go to wherever the link would direct them to.<br><br>
                        
                        Basic Formatting - This covers all the basic ways we can change text in something like our word documents when we either click the relative button or use the CTRL+ whatever format you wish to use, these being: ‘b’ for making your text ‘bold’ making it stand out more, ‘i’ for making your text ‘italicized’ making it look a bit more unique and catch the eye of the reader, and finally ‘u’ to ‘underline’ the text.<br><br>
                        
                        Head - A head isn’t so much important to the user of the website as it is to the browser itself. Within the head of the page there will be content relating to different scripts, stylesheets, and other features that the rest of the website will need to function and look the way the creater of it intended for it to be.<br><br>
                        
                        Body - Within HTML you will have everything in its own specific field. Everything will be in the HTML tags which then have the ‘head’ tag as the very first thing following. After you’ve settled on what you want your header to say and how you want it to look below it you’ll be putting everything else into the ‘body’ tag which is a sort of container holding all the content on the current page.<br><br>
                        
                        USAGE - just about everything you will do within HTML will be done within the ‘body’ tags. The header will only contain the very heading of the website while all the other information will be outside of the ‘header’ tags and within the ‘body’ tags. Of course, there can be exceptions for things like scripts and style tags which are the main 2 exceptions.<br><br>
                        
                        Children - Using children in your HTML will create a sort of hierarchy in the HTML which create an element that’s an immediate descendent of another element within the HTML or is ‘nested’/located within another element.
                        
                        Comments - Comments in HTML aren’t actually something that the user of the website would be able to see. These are used and visible only for the people actually working on the HTML and can be used for a range of different things like leaving a reminder for yourself about a possible fix to a problem, if you’re working in a group these can be used as a note for others in relation to something like a new idea, or they can be used to help you group everything and possible make it easier for you to find different parts of the code by looking at the comment rather than going through all the code to figure out what’s where.<br><br>
                        
                        DIV - the ‘Div’ tag in HTML shows a division in the document or a specific section. A div tag can be very useful to help style everything with CSS as it’ll provide an extra layer of flexibility to what can be done to all the different parts of your code similar to why you would use a class element.<br><br>
                        
                        Headings - The Heading elements within HTML are usually shown as h1, h2, h3 and so on. These headings help break up the website into chunks, logical sections that make it easier to arrange and later edit everything.<br><br>
                        
                        Horizontal Rules - Using Horizontal Rules in HTML by typing in ‘hr’ will create a black, pixel thick line across the page that separates one part of the website form the other. This, like just about every other part of HTML can later be changed in CSS if it was desired.<br><br>
                        </p>
            </div>
            <div class="Extra">
                <h6>Extra</h6>
                <p>Paragraphs - Paragraphs(p) is the most common and sued HTML tag which holds most of the text found in websites. These tags will usually contain/nest other tags inside them like img, a, strong, em, and more.<br><br>
                        Semantic Formatting - These tags are very similar to those mentioned before only that they’re not used quite as much. These tags hold some sort of meaning such as using ‘em’ to emphasize something and ‘strong’ to show importance. Tags like these can be nested in itself for a better end result.<br><br>
                        Tables - This element of HTML will help display parts of the website in rows and columns depending on how it’s set up. This element can contain others such as a header element.<br><br>
                        Tags & Elements -  Tags & Elements separate and help create everything within HTML, tags label different sections of elements. Every tag is created using angle brackets and holds a key word, content is placed between these angle brackets and the finishing pair that contain a slash followed by whatever tag was previously used.<br><br>
                        Title - This is possibly the most straight forward part of HTML as it’s function is to tell the browser what to display as the title of the website. This tag goes between the ‘head’ tags.<br><br>
